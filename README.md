# University-Management-System-Python-
1.	Name of the Project
University Management System 
2.	Introduction
In this project, we are going to design a system for any institute that stores information for the students ,faculty & courses. The record is only accessed & maintained by the admin. The admin is the only authorized personnel who can access & manipulate the data respectively. Rest all the necessary work is done accordingly & opted to achieve our project goal.
3.	Problem Statement
 		Starting with the problem statement, the old system starts with the registration of their staff and students. When the students and faculty are registering for the university the Head of the Department should enter every detail of students and faculty in the Excel sheets. Then the staff enters corresponding details like their name, aggregate, gender, and much more also to be entered in the Excel sheets and validations are to be done by the user itself. So, there will be a lot of work to be done and must be more conscious during the entrance of details.
4.	Methodology

Here is Our Some plan and Methodology to develop and solve the problem.

•	Admin Login\Sign Up Page:

	The page where the system admin enters their system credentials to gain access to the system’s admin side. 
	Admin can change his password using forget password option 

•	Students Registration Management:

	The page where admin gathers the important information of the students and enter them in system to register the student. This information is used to track their current stats.  

•	Faculty Registration Management:

	The page where admin collects the important details of the faculty and enter them in system to register the faculty in UMS. Can be used to delete or modify information of faculty person.

•	Course Registration Management:

	The university admin will have to set the selected courses for every student, then assign an appropriate instructor to the subjects covered by each course.
	And any changes can be done by modifying the details.



•	Display All Managements in A Proper Way:

	At last, all the information is collected now its time to connect all the management system with login system to make the system run and secure.
	Display the information to user in a friendly way.



How it works exactly.

STEPS

Admin Side:
•	 User asked to enter the system credentials to login.
•	 Screen displays result in the following: student, faculty, and course management.
•	After that program will give option to admin to choose from which function, he/she want to perform.
Developer Side:
•	Declare variables that are going to be used in program (string and integer variables for input and results).
•	Must input only integers to choose desire option from menus.
•	We use standard doubly linked list and its simple functions in our project.
5.	Specifications:
As we have a finite knowledge about Python OOP and Data Structure concepts which we studied in this semester. So, we applied all that knowledge, and our team experience to get our project done.

We made code for the University Management System which make the work process easy we use:
•	Classes 
•	Doubly linked list
•	Functions
•	Objects
•	Inheritance (In terms of linking the different files in one file, use different functions of other files and make it single .EXE file.
•	Different loops(if else , while)

Processing of code:

In this code we made the Login page for Sign Up/Login , after successfully login to the UMS, Admin have options  from the Main Menu, to choose which operations to perform like student’s registration , faculty registration and course registration. After selection of one option, he/she will have further sub menus to perform further operations in UMS. He/She will have further options to return to main menu.
